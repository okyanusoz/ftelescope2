# ftelescope2

A redesign of a website I really didn't like.

## Development

**Note: yarn is the recommended package manager for this project. You can still use npm, but this project was built with yarn and therefore contains Yarn lockfiles. Things may or may not work.**

```
yarn
yarn dev
```


## Building for production
```
yarn # if you haven't already
yarn build
yarn export
```

## License

MIT.

It would be fun to see this fun little project be integrated into the real website.
